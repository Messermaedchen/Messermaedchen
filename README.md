- 👋 Hi, I’m @Messermaedchen
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about
 the world of computer science, all kind of 
  Technologies and hopefully programming languages 
  Computers and IT and hacking are topics 
that I haven't any knowledge about. 
But I find it simply amazing, extremely exciting 
and grateful for this opportunity. 
Actually also a bit nervous about these new topics. 
 Too understand/translate what is going on
 is sometimes not easy. Please let me tell you
 whatever I am doing here comes from my heart 
and trying my best to learn fast. 
Grizzly bear hug ♥️ 
take care, stay safe and healthy 🤗
